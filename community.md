# Community Guidelines

Thanks for joining Anecdote! We hope you have an incredible time exploring real, vulnerable stories from people all over the world. Before you get started, we want to remind you of our community guidelines. 
 
Be Kind
We are a community of storytellers of all different ages and backgrounds. Refrain from 
discrimination, hate speech, bullying, or targeted attacks            
Be considerate of the content you post. Don't post content that is libelous, defamatory, harassing, threatening, or inflammatory. Refrain from posting obscene, violent, graphic, pornagraphic content.
 
Be Yourself
At Anecdote, we want to hear your stories and the things you have to say, but we also need you to be respectful of others' privacy and ownership.
Don't post content that invades others' privacy. For example, don't post other people's 
phone numbers, email addresses, mailing addresses, or other personal information, and 
don't post links to phishing or other malware sites.
Don't impersonate other people or organizations or pretend to be someone or something you're not.

Be Mindful
Don't repeatedly send messages or requests to other people.
Don't attempt to drown out other people's opinions, including by posting from multiple accounts or coordinating with others.
Don't engage in name-calling or attack people based on whether you agree with them.
